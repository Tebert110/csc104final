    <h2>Some of the tips that I suggest for plastic and resin models.</h2>
    <!-- setting break between the the h2 and the next section -->
    &nbsp;

<p>
The key is to take your time. When using snips, you put them as close to the edge of the model as you can to cut it. So, there is less debris when removing the mold lines. I recommend setting up everything in various stages. So, you can prime and paint things separately, which makes it more accessible, and then put everything together when you are done painting. And when painting. Make sure you water down the colors that you need or thin them out. And always pick colors that are going to complement each other. It is always good to look at a color wheel.

<br> 
I will have a test model on which to test different paints and textures before I paint my final project. That's working with plastics.  
<br>
The other type of models that you could be working on. They are made from resin. When working with resin models. The first step that I do is to wash the model in warm, soapy water. Wear a mask when removing any excess debris or mold lines. I do use sandpaper to clean those. And then on the surface as well. Also, use a model knife to clean more minor details. Once I finish all of that. I will then use fine sandpaper, either 1000 grit to 3000 grit. And do a slight sanding on it before priming the model. With resin models you may get e gaps. When this happens. You can use putty or stuff that is called green stuff to fill in the gaps, once it dries. You'll have to clean up the area and sand it smoothly, so it blends in with the rest. And then prime your model. Then, paint your model in any color that you want. 
<br>
You can use magnets to hold plastic and resin models together or to change their positions. You can use a drill to drill the area for the magnet. There are many sizes of magnets that you can buy. It is vital to mark the magnets. Which face should go into the model, and which face should go out. So, you do not have magnets opposing each other when you finish.  
<br>
On resin models it is best to use superglue. On plastic models. You can use superglue or plastic glue 
<br>
When it comes to painting, safety is paramount. Whether I'm spray painting, airbrushing, or painting details with a brush, I always wear gloves and a respirator. This not only protects me from the fumes but also prevents my fingerprints from smudging in the fresh paint. These precautions ensure a safe and enjoyable model-making experience.  
<br>
Remember to be safe, have fun, and take your time.
